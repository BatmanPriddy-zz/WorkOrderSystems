# Work Order Systems

Example code from the work order system integration project currently being implemented.  This repository contains the back end code for processing work orders on the follow two systems:

> **Maximo**

> **MyMCS**

Unfortunately the UI contains proprietary information, and thus cannot be included.

There are still a few details to be hashed out with with vendors, and currently in the process of including commenting of this code base, where necessary.

Thank you and feel free to clone this repository any time.
